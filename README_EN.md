### Setting up a debate

Here are the provided functions on the segments of debate competitions, which is aligned on the left of the page:

- **Segment title,** which allows the user to set the title used in each part of the debate.
- **Time for each team,** which allows the users to determine the time for each team.
- **Time for ...,** which allows the user to decide which team to time for. The detailed information will be mentioned in the following part.

After clicking on the "Begin!" button at the right bottom corner of the settings page, the software will display the first page of all segments.

On the top of the page, the title of the segment will be displayed on the top of the page, and on the top right there are two buttons, relatively used to minimize the window. Please note that this version of the software would **NOT** save any data after closing.

Beneath the title, information of the two teams are shown, involving the text "Pro" and "Con", the team names and the viewpoints. The remaining time will be displayed below the team information.
